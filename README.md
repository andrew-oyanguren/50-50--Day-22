### General Information
This project was a really good one. I can see me implementing stuff I learned in this project into future sliders. created a function that took in an argument and used an if statement to check the condition of that argument. Base on if that argument was up or down you would transform translate the div element a percentage of its height, which we got using the web API .clientHeight.
